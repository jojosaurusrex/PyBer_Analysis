# PyBer_Analysis

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, Pyber_ride_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.2, Jupyter Notebook 4.10.3

##Overview
Pyber Analysis gave me an opportunity to learn and present my visual presentation skills by using matplotlib. I learned and presented how to:
- create different types of charts using MATLAB and Object-Oriented approaches
- annotate charts
- use grouby function to manipulate data frames
- summarize statistics by creating a new dataframe

##Results
The results of the assignment revealed that there were differences in drivers, fares, and ride count across three different types of cities: rural, suburban, and urban.

Figure 2.

In the Figure 1 we can see that most of the rides are done within the urban cities and the least amount of activity occuring in the rural area. Figure 2 backs up this result with a boxplot, which presents the median, mode, and mean of the ride count data for each city type neatly on the same graph.

Figure 4.

In Figure 3, the data presents the mean, mode, and median of the fare data for each city type. This shows that urban rides cos the least of the three; while, rural rides cost the most of the three. The reason behind this could be due to the lack of drivers in the rural area versus how many drivers there are in urban areas. Figure 4 represents this data extremely well. Figure 5 summarizes the number of rides, drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and driver over the four month period of data that we are analyzing. Figure 6 shows a summary of the fare paid by the rider across the different city types.

##Summary
One suggestion I would make to the CEO would be to offer an incentive to drivers that live/work in rural areas, so that there could be more drivers in that area which may lead to an increase of more riders. Another suggestion would be to offer urban drivers a differnt type of incentive after they have been working for a certain period of time because it will help retain the great drivers which could lead to more riders using Pyber. Lastly, Pyber should offer incentives to their customers by offering them some sort of credit during the periods of time when Pyber activity drops. Allowing Pyber to increase revenue by a bit more when they might have not otherwise.
